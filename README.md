This mobile application was designed to help users keep track of events in their life. The users need to be able to login or create an account for their information to be stored. They also need to be able to create events, edit events existing information, delete events, and opt into SMS reminders. Multiple screens were needed to add this functionality. There is a screen to login/register an account, a screen to view currently listed events, a screen to add a new event, and a screen to edit existing events. There also needs to be another screen to provide the option of opting for SMS reminders. 


I kept the user in mind when designing the UI through the placement of components and the color scheme. I decided to use a mellow matcha palette to make a cohesive design. I also focused on making the UI accessible to users by adding properties that allow for text scaling, and making sure the minimum size of a button and distance between click components was large enough to meet Androids standards. 


When approaching the process of coding I worked iteratively to complete one feature at a time. I listed out the different screens needed, and the user needs that way I could keep track of what has been done. I first designed the UI for the main screens then tested the RecylerView display of the events with example data. After knowing events would be displayed properly, I developed the login database and tested it. Lastly, I implemented the CRUD functionalities one at a time. I tested the code in each of these steps to make sure it was functioning as intended. This process was important, as if one function wasn’t working it could cause errors in the next function made. 


The development process of this app was quite difficult as I am new to Android development and the documentation was much different than what I am used to. To overcome challenges in development I ended up reading a lot of forum posts of people using similar API’s to piece together what was going wrong.
Overall, I am mainly satisfied with the UI appearance of my app. I plan to work more on this app to polish how it looks and add more features overtime, but I think the visual design has a lot of potential and in the end could show my overall knowledge in design principles.
